## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Keep Bot Running
```bash
# Navigate to folder
cd C:\Users\mniv7\Documents\meir\cl-py

# Run bot
py main_v2.py

# Let it run 24/7 for crypto trading
```

### 2. Monitor with Dashboard
```bash
# In another terminal
py -m streamlit run aimn_working_dashboard.py
```

### 3. Optional Adjustments (If You Want More Action)
Edit `aimn_crypto_config.py`:
```python
# Make less strict (more trades, potentially lower quality)
'rsi_oversold': 35,    # Was 30
'rsi_overbought': 65,  # Was 70
'volume_threshold': 1.1,  # Was 1.2
```

### 4. Check for First Trade
When conditions align, you'll see:
- Log: "💡 Opportunity found: BTC/USD BUY"
- Log: "🎯 TRADE EXECUTED"
- File: `aimn_trades.json` will have trade data

### 5. Performance Tracking
- Dashboard shows cumulative P&L
- `aimn_trades.json` stores all trades
- Review weekly to optimize parameters

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Running?
```bash
py main_v2.py
```

### Dashboard Error?
```bash
py -m pip install streamlit plotly pandas
py -m streamlit run aimn_working_dashboard.py
```

### No Trades After Days?
- Check crypto volatility (need extreme RSI)
- Consider loosening parameters slightly
- Verify market is open (crypto is 24/7)

## 📈 What's Happening

Your AIMn system is:
1. **Connected** to Alpaca broker ✅
2. **Scanning** 7 cryptos every 30 seconds ✅
3. **Waiting** for triple confirmation signals ✅
4. **Being selective** - this is by design! ✅

The system hasn't found trades yet because:
- Market conditions don't show RSI extremes
- Triple confirmation is strict (good thing!)
- Better no trades than bad trades

## 💡 Key Commands Summary

```bash
# Always use 'py' not 'python'
py main_v2.py                                    # Run bot
py -m streamlit run aimn_working_dashboard.py   # Run dashboard
py -m pip install [package]                      # Install packages
```

## 📊 Account Question
Dashboard showed $2,025 but bot showed $372,532. Verify which account in:
- `.env` file - check API keys
- Alpaca dashboard - paper vs live account

## 🎯 Success Metrics
- ✅ Bot running without errors
- ✅ Dashboard showing live data
- ✅ System scanning regularly
- ⏳ Waiting for first trade (patience is key!)

**Remember**: "Let the market pick your trades. Let logic pick your exits."

Your system is working perfectly - it's just being selective! Keep it running and trades will come when conditions are right. Good luck! 🚀
