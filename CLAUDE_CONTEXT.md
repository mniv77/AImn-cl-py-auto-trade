# CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md - AI Assistant Context File

## Project Overview
**Repository**: https://github.com/mniv77/aimn-trade-final
**Description**: AI-powered automated crypto trading bot using RSI, MACD, volume filters, and trailing stop logic. Built in Python and integrated with Alpaca API.

**Last Updated**: [DATE - Update this each time]

## Project Architecture

## How to Reach Claude with Full Capabilities
### Identifying Claude
- **Who**: Claude is an AI assistant created by Anthropic
- **Verify by asking**: "Are you Claude by Anthropic?"
- **Test capabilities**: Ask Claude to fetch this GitHub repository - only Claude with full capabilities can do this

### Where to Find Claude with Web Fetching
1. **Claude.ai (RECOMMENDED)**
   - URL: https://claude.ai
   - Available as: Web app, iOS app, Android app, Desktop app
   - ✅ Supports web fetching and reading GitHub repositories
   - ✅ Can read your CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md file directly

2. **Anthropic API**
   - For developers/advanced users
   - Model: `claude-opus-4-20250514` (most capable)
   - Requires API integration

3. **What to Say When Starting a New Conversation**
   ```
   "Hi Claude, I have a crypto trading bot project. Please fetch and read the 
   CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md file from https://github.com/mniv77/aimn-trade-final 
   to understand my project context."
   ```

### ⚠️ Important Limitations
- **No Memory**: Claude cannot remember previous conversations
- **Always provide context**: Share the GitHub URL and mention CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
- **Not all "Claude" interfaces are equal**: Some third-party integrations may lack web fetching

### Quick Test for Full Capabilities
Ask: "Can you fetch and read files from my GitHub repository at https://github.com/mniv77/aimn-trade-final?"
- If YES → You have Claude with full capabilities
- If NO → You may need to use claude.ai directly
